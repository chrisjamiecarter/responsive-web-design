          C# is the most popular language for the .NET platform, a free, cross-platform, open-source development environment. It enables developers to write applications for IoT devices, the cloud, phones, desktops, laptops, and servers.
          </p>
          <p class="documentation">
As a cross-platform, general-purpose language, C# boosts developer productivity while ensuring high performance. Its broad ecosystem support spans all .NET workloads. Rooted in object-oriented principles, C# also incorporates features from other paradigms, including functional programming. Low-level features allow for high-efficiency scenarios without requiring unsafe code. The majority of the .NET runtime and libraries are written in C#, ensuring that advancements in C# benefit all .NET developers.

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p class="documentation">To introduce you to the C# programming language, see the below "Hello, World" program:</p>
        <code>// This line prints "Hello, World"
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Types">
        <header>Types</header>
        <p class="documentation">C# types are categorized into two main groups:</p>
          <h3>Value Types</h3>
          <p class="documentation">
    Variables of value types contain the actual instance of the type.</p>
    <p class="documentation">
    When assigned, passed as arguments, or returned from methods, the value is copied.
    </p>
<h3>Reference Types</h3>
<p class="documentation">
    Variables of reference types contain a reference (pointer) to the instance, not the instance itself.
    </p>
    <p class="documentation">
    When assigned, passed as arguments, or returned from methods, only the reference is copied, not the instance.
    </p>
<p class="documentation">
In summary, value types store the data directly, while reference types store a pointer to the data. Value types are copied by value, and reference types are copied by reference.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Keywords">
        <header>Keywords</header>
        <p class="documentation">
          Keywords are reserved identifiers with special meanings to the compiler. They cannot be used as variable or method names unless prefixed with @ (e.g., @if is valid, but if is not). There are two types of keywords in C#:
          </p>
          <p class="documentation">
            Reserved Keywords: These cannot be used as identifiers anywhere in the program.
    Contextual Keywords: These have special meaning only in specific contexts and can be used as identifiers outside those contexts.
          </p>
          <p class="documentation">
            As new keywords are introduced in C#, they are typically added as contextual keywords to avoid breaking existing programs written in earlier versions.

      <section class="main-section" id="Operators_and_expressions">
        <header>Operators and expressions</header>
        <p class="documentation">
          C# provides various operators that can be used with built-in types to perform basic operations. These include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Arithmetic Operators: Perform arithmetic operations on numeric operands (e.g., +, -, *, /, %).
            </li>
            <li>
              Comparison Operators: Compare numeric operands (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
            </li>
            <li>
              Logical Operators: Perform logical operations on bool operands (e.g., &&, ||, !).
            </li>
            <li>
              Bitwise and Shift Operators: Perform bitwise or shift operations on integral types.
            </li>
            <li>
              Equality Operators: Check if operands are equal or not (e.g., ==, !=).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="documentation">
            These operators can be overloaded to specify behavior for user-defined types. Expressions in C# can be formed by combining literals, variables, and operators. Operator precedence and associativity determine the order of evaluation, which can be altered using parentheses.

      <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
        <header>Statements</header>
        <h3>Declaration statements</h3>
        <p class="documentation">A declaration statement declares a new local variable, local constant, or local reference variable. To declare a local variable, specify its type and provide its name. You can declare multiple variables of the same type in one statement.</p>
        <code>string greeting;
          int a, b, c;
          List&lt;double&gt; xs;</code>
        <h3>Exception-handling statements</h3>
        <p class="documentation">Use the try-catch statement to handle exceptions that might occur during execution of a code block. Place the code where an exception might occur inside a try block. Use a catch clause to specify the base type of exceptions you want to handle in the corresponding catch block</p>
        <code>try
{
<span class="indent">var result = Process(-3, 4);</span>
<span class="indent">Console.WriteLine($"Processing succeeded: {result}");</span>
}
catch (ArgumentException e)
{
<span class="indent">Console.WriteLine($"Processing failed: {e.Message}");</span>
}</code>
        <h3>Iteration statements</h3>
        <p class="documentation">C# provides several iteration statements to repeatedly execute a block of code:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              for loop: Executes a block of code while a specified Boolean expression is true.
            </li>
            <li>
              foreach loop: Enumerates elements in a collection and executes a block of code for each element.
            </li>
            <li>
              do...while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, then continues executing it while a specified condition is true.
            </li>
            <li>
              while loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly while a specified condition is true. May not execute at all if the condition is initially false.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="documentation">
            Within any of these loops, you can:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use the break statement to exit the loop prematurely.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the continue statement to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p class="documentation">
            These iteration statements allow you to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions or collections.
          </p>
        <code>for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            <span class="indent">Console.Write(i);</span>
        }
        // Output:
        // 012</code>
        <h3>Selection statements</h3>
        <p class="documentation">
          C# provides several conditional statements to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions or expressions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified Boolean expression evaluates to true.</li>
            <li>if-else statement: Executes one block of code if a Boolean expression is true, and another block if it's false.</li>
            <li>switch statement: Evaluates an expression and executes the associated block of code based on a pattern match with the expression's value.</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="documentation">
          These statements allow you to create branching logic in your program, enabling different code paths to be executed based on specific conditions or values. The if and if-else statements are useful for simple conditional checks, while the switch statement is more suitable for multiple conditions or cases.
        </p>
        <code>DisplayWeatherReport(15.0);  // Output: Cold.
              DisplayWeatherReport(24.0);  // Output: Perfect!
              
              void DisplayWeatherReport(double tempInCelsius)
              {
                <span class="indent">if (tempInCelsius < 20.0)</span>
                <span class="indent">{</span>
                <span class="indent"><span class="indent">Console.WriteLine("Cold.");</span></span>
                <span class="indent">}</span>
                <span class="indent">else</span>
                <span class="indent">{</span>
                <span class="indent"><span class="indent">Console.WriteLine("Perfect!");</span></span>
                <span class="indent">}</span>
